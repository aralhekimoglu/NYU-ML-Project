# Quidditch Professionalism Analysis

In this project, our aim was to build a full data science solution to deciding whether a given quidditch player with its features would be selected a pro/or not. 

## This project includes:

* Selecting a correct evaluation metric, since accuracy was not an option due to the imbalance in data.
* Data cleaning and transformations.
* Feature Engineering.
* Dealing with data imbalance: subsampling or oversampling methods
* Testing different scikit-learn machine learning models and deciding on the best fit.
